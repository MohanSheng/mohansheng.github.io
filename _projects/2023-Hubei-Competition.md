In this project, I utilised satellite imagery from the European Space Agency's Sentinel series and Landsat 8 to extract and analyse water area changes over time. Using platforms such as Google Earth Engine, ENVI, and ArcGIS, I processed multi-temporal optical and SAR data to evaluate and optimise water body extraction algorithms, improving both accuracy and computational efficiency. I built a time-series database documenting years of water area changes in Hubei Province and analysed their correlation with regional climatic factors, such as precipitation and temperature, using multivariate regression analysis. Additionally, I modelled flood inundation areas to assess impacts during flood events, supporting precision relief efforts and agricultural evaluations. This project provided scientific insights into the quantitative relationship between climate fluctuations and changes in lakes and reservoirs, offering valuable references for regional economic development and climate adaptation strategies.
