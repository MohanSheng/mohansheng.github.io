During my internship as a GIS Analyst for a resort project, I led the design, processing, and application analysis of a 2D and 3D foundational spatial database using ArcGIS. At the project's outset, I developed a geographic entity feature database encompassing roads, buildings, ponds, vegetation, and car parks, meticulously defining attribute information for each layer. Building on the database, I analysed road network connectivity within the resort and identified optimal routes. For surveillance camera placement, I evaluated visibility zones based on terrain and building distribution, optimising coverage efficiency. Finally, I utilised 3D visualisation techniques to create an interactive 3D navigation map of the area, enhancing the visitor experience and improving customer satisfaction.

Also, I gained hands-on experience in UAV-based field surveys and geospatial data processing. I designed and implemented ground control point (GCP) strategies to ensure data accuracy, conducting precise GNSS RTK measurements across an 870,000 mÂ² survey area. This involved carefully distributing control and check points, accounting for potential obstacles, and establishing backup points to mitigate risks. Leveraging drone imagery, I generated accurate DSM, DEM, and DOM products, and optimised processing workflows. Conducted point cloud analysis and executed 3D reconstruction using AR.Explorer, PhotoScan, and ContextCapture. Performed  3D building modeling and geographic feature extraction with DP_Mapper and DP_Modeler.
