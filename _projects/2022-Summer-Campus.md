During my campus-based internship, I led a team of eight in 3D laser scanning using a Leica P50 LiDAR scanner to capture detailed point cloud data of building structures and tunnel cross-sections. Faced with a tight schedule, I independently learnt the equipment in three days, trained my teammates, and ensured a smooth operation. We scanned the tunnel structure, processed the data in Cyclone through registration, merging, and modelling, and successfully generated a 3D tunnel model. I refined cross-section images in AutoCAD and performed multi-station LiDAR data stitching and optimisation to enhance spatial accuracy and visualisation quality, delivering high-quality results under pressure.
