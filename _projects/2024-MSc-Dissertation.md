In my masterâ€™s dissertation, I investigated the detection of windthrow events in the Amazon rainforest using Sentinel-1 SAR data, comparing its effectiveness to Sentinel-2 optical data. I processed and analysed radar backscatter and multispectral images from the Google Earth Engine platform, applying time-series analysis to identify changes before and after windthrow events. My research explored the strengths and limitations of SAR data in monitoring forest damage, particularly in complex terrains with high vegetation density, and highlighted the potential for integrating multi-source satellite data to enhance detection accuracy.
