I am an enthusiastic GIS professional with extensive experience in both desk-based and field roles, where I have developed strong skills in geospatial analysis, environmental modelling, and remote sensing. I am actively expanding my expertise in GIS, programming, data management, analysis, and visualisation.

I am proficient in ArcGIS, QGIS, Flood Modeller, Python, and RStudio, as well as other GIS software and technical skills. My academic background spans a variety of disciplines, including but not limited to geomatics engineering (I graduated from Wuhan University with a BSc in Geomatics), environmental monitoring (Soon to graduate from The University of Manchester with an MSc in Environmental Monitoring, Modelling and Reconstruction) and GIS applications (Across both). Additionally, I am highly skilled in Microsoft Office applications, including Excel, Word, and PowerPoint.

My past experiences allow me to effectively motivate and lead teams, tailoring strategies to meet both short-term and long-term objectives as required by the project. With this combination of technical expertise and communication skills, I am confident in my ability to make meaningful contributions to any organisation.

I'm a passionate problem-solver, and endevour learn as much as possible in cross-disciplinary tasks. My projects can be found on my [Projects](/projects/) page.

## Hobbies
Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, climbing, and travelling, embracing outdoor activities as a way to stay active and inspired.
